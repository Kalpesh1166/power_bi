Hello Everyone ðŸ¤— delight to share insights I've uncovered and understand during my internship of Mentorness.

Here's a snapshot of what I've discovered Relation of data:

Trends Analysis: Thoroughly examined historical data to identify patterns and trends in airplane crash rates over the past decade.

Safety Recommendations: Developed actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing aviation safety based on the findings of the analysis.

Root Cause Investigation: Delved into the underlying factors contributing to airplane crashes, pinpointing common themes and areas for improvement.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply my analytical skills in a real-world context and contribute to discussions surrounding aviation safety.
